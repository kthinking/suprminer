# ccminer

suprminer sp-mod (august 2018) optimized x16r algo without any dev fee.

Most optimizations come from sp, so please support him.

Overclock the core and memory for the best performance

This variant was tested and built on Linux (ubuntu server 14.04, 16.04, Fedora 22 to 25)
It is also built for Windows 7 to 10 with VStudio 2013, to stay compatible with Windows 7 and Vista.

Note that the x86 releases are generally faster than x64 ones on Windows, but that tend to change with the recent drivers.

The recommended CUDA Toolkit version is 9.2
------------------------------

This project requires some libraries to be built :

- OpenSSL (prebuilt for win)
- Curl (prebuilt for win)
- pthreads (prebuilt for win)

The tree now contains recent prebuilt openssl and curl .lib for both x86 and x64 platforms (windows).

To rebuild them, you need to clone this repository and its submodules :
    git clone https://github.com/peters/curl-for-windows.git compat/curl-for-windows


Compile on Linux
